# Introduction
> The synergistic nature of urbanization and climate change makes for a warm air mass safe haven in (Luber and McGeehin, 2008). Climate change has been exacerbating the frequency of intense heat waves and co-contributing to raised air temperatures in many urban locations. A high-ranking problematic side effect of excessive heat is public health issues. There is observed causality between heat and health that has negative repercussions for humans (Patz. et al, 2005). Heat-related mortality is highest in comparison to other severe weather-related events and the human bodyâ€™s reaction anthropogenic heat is equivalent to that of a reaction to naturally occurring extreme heat waves (Davis et. al, 2003). Citizens of cities such as Phoenix and Los Angeles are of the most at-risk populations in the United States due to their existing climate.
